# Auth
#### Sapper Authentication Implementation for Wordpress

The structure of Auth is based on the svelte/sapper [realworld project](https://github.com/sveltejs/realworld)

Written using Svelte V3 and using the wp oauth server plugin.

### Bugs and feedback

If you use Auth and come across any bugs or if you have any ideas about how to improve it please do open an issue or PM me in the Svelte Discord group.

### What's missing

Currently there is no implementation for "Forgotten Password" or "Reset Password" open to ideas!
